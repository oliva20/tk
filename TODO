[x] Create a custom marker that will ask the user what type of transport were they on.
        -> This should have sort of model with (Spinner, "What were you on?").

[x] Generate tests for the markers.

[x] Create a manager to calculate the emissions from transports;

[x] Look into migrating the project to TypeScript;
    - It would be easy but haven't got the time atm.

[ ] Fix the warning on every child should have props key;

[ ] Refactor the infoWindow for better aesthetics. It also does not include all the 
    possible transports.
    -> We need to display all the available modes of transport. Now all this won't fit inside a 
    custom marker window so the only solution would be to use a modal. 
        - The modal shows once the user presses the marker.
        - Then there is a picker for the user to choose the transport.
        - A button to close is displayed at the button or a simple 'X' in the corner.

[x] The main screen is not rounding the co2 result.
[ ] Create an introduction splash screen.

[ ] Add a permission check for the location.

NOTES** 
-> There is an issue with the callout of mapview. So the only soluion is to use
a modal to ask the user for the type of transport.
